MY DIET TRACKER

DESCRIPTION:

Researches show that people who have a diet diary and log calories lose more weight. It is also more likely that they keep the weight off over the long run. MyDietTracker application aims to provide users an easy way to manage their daily calorie intake and consumption. 

This app calculates the user’s ideal weight and provides a personalized recommendation for calorie intake based on the user weight, height, age and gender. The users can log their weights in order to keep track of their weight changes.

The users can keep track of their daily calorie intake and outtake by using their food diary/ daily food list and exercise log.
